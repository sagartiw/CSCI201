# StuOrgCentral

**This web application was submitted for a CSCI201 Final Project in Fall 2020.**

StuOrgCentral is a web application that allows USC students to filter and find RSO Events. This application was implemented using MERN Stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node), and includes features such as keyword search, multilevel roles & permissions, real time alerts, and complete CRUD functionality.


Here is the standard home page, complete with a search bar and details buttons for events.
